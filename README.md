# infolines.vim
infolines.vim is a simple statusline and tabline plugin for Vim. This plugin should support any font that supports Unicdoe/UTF-8. This plugin's primary design philosophy is 'minimalism' and that includes NO patched fonts.

## Requirements / Dependecies of infolines.vim

I use [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) when I code. I use it on all of my machines. This plugin is using a handful of Unicode characters that are supported by Source Code Pro. I would assume that any font that supports the following Unicode characters would work with infolines.vim:
- ‚éá [UTF-8 E2 8E 87](http://apps.timwhitlock.info/unicode/inspect?s=%E2%8E%87)
- ‚ò∞ [UTF-8 E2 98 B0](http://apps.timwhitlock.info/unicode/inspect?s=%E2%98%B0)
- üîí[UTF-8 F0 9F 94 92](http://apps.timwhitlock.info/unicode/inspect?s=%F0%9F%94%92)
- üí©[UTF-8 F0 9F 92 A9](http://apps.timwhitlock.info/unicode/inspect?s=%F0%9F%92%A9)
- ‚óã [UTF-8 E2 97 A6](http://apps.timwhitlock.info/unicode/inspect?s=%E2%97%A6)
- ‚óè [UTF-8 E2 80 A2](http://apps.timwhitlock.info/unicode/inspect?s=%E2%80%A2)
- ‚ñ™ [UTF-8 E2 96 AA](http://apps.timwhitlock.info/unicode/inspect?s=%E2%96%AA)
- ‚Äñ [UTF-8 E2 80 96](http://apps.timwhitlock.info/unicode/inspect?s=%E2%80%96)

Make sure the Vim encoding is set to UTF-8 to display these symbols.

## Roadmap
I would like to add the following features:
- If statements so that a particular font is not needed and the information comes across well.
- The tabline is something that I am working on in my .vimrc. A prototype will be added when I get it provisionally working.
- I would like to allow people to change the color dictionary to meet their color scheme or figure out a way for the dictionary to automatically adopt colors from the selected color scheme. (This is a ways down the line. It is easy enough to modify this source.
- I would like to clean up the if statements a bit and add more surrounding file size.

## Version History
- v 0.0.1 - The statusline is useable for my needs. Tabline is not even started.
